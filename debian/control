Description: mark a function or property as deprecated - Node.js module
 This module goes above and beyond with deprecation warnings by introspecting
 the call stack (but only the bits that it is interested in).
 .
 Instead of just warning on the first invocation of a deprecated function and
 never again, this module will warn on the first invocation of a deprecated
 function per unique call site, making it ideal to alert users of all
 deprecated uses across the code base, rather than just whatever happens to
 execute first.
 .
 The deprecation warnings from this module also include the file and line
 information for the call into the module that the deprecated function was in.
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
